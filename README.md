## Assignments

1. **Logistic Regression Assignment**:
   - In this assignment, I implemented logistic regression to solve a specific problem.
   - Objective: Predicted probabilities of each digit using Logistic Regression.

2. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Assignment**:
   - Build a 2-layer MLP for MNIST digit classification using the following design:
     - Input (784 dimensions) -> Fully Connected Layer (500 hidden units) -> ReLU Activation -> Fully Connected Layer (100 hidden units) -> ReLU Activation -> Fully Connected Layer (10 hidden units) -> Softmax Activation.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Assignment**:
   - Build a 2-layer CNN for MNIST digit classification with this configuration:
     - Input Image -> Convolution Layer (32 filters, 5x5) -> ReLU Activation -> Max Pooling (2x2) -> Convolution Layer (64 filters, 5x5) -> ReLU Activation -> Max Pooling (2x2) -> Fully Connected Layer (256 hidden units) -> ReLU Activation -> Fully Connected Layer (10 hidden units) -> Softmax Activation.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- TensorFlow 2.14.0
